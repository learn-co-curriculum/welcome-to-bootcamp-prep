1. * ## Welcome[![](http://)](http://)

This prep course will guide you through the fundamentals of programming in both Javascript and Ruby. Beyond just covering languages, you'll also learn how to work like a developer. You'll get set up with a developer environment and you'll be writing your code in a text editor and executing it in a terminal. You'll learn about test driven development and use a developer workflow when writing and testing your code. 

## How this Course is Structured

We'll get started with Javascript fundamentals and the basic syntax of the language. We'll dive into functions, data structures, and looping and then we'll cover the DOM and how to modify HTML with Javascript. You'll work with jQuery and end this section by building a web application game. 

Then we'll move on to Ruby fundamentals, where we will reinforce the basic concepts of programming by showing them to you in the context of a new language. In addition, we'll also cover the basics of object oriented programming. Throughout Ruby fundamentals, you'll be building a command line Tic Tac Toe game which will teach you how to think like a programmer by taking a complicated application and breaking it down into its smaller, component parts. 

In the final section you'll get a sample of our Career Prep track that all of our immersive students go through as they reach the end of their technical training. This sample curriculum will give tactical advice on various aspects of interviewing, from communicating with recruiters to preparing for the actual interview to approaching code challenges that you'll complete following an interview.

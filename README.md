## Welcome to Bootcamp Prep!

Every day, you probably use at least one web application to make something in your life easier. It might be to send and receive email, get updates on friends’ lives on social media or buy movie tickets. Or it might be to share documents, search digital newspapers for the latest news, or watch video clips, or a million other things you want to do on a daily basis. Software made to run on the web is now an essential part of our lives — and not only can you use it, but you can also learn how to create it.

That’s where we come in. Over the course of Bootcamp Prep, we’ll bring you into the world of web development and teach you all the fundamentals. You’ll learn about the building blocks of the web: HTML and CSS. You’ll learn how programming works with JavaScript, and you’ll also learn the basics of the Ruby programming language. At the end of the course, you’ll be prepared to take on the full Flatiron School Software Engineering or Online Web Developer program and become a real web developer. After completing the first 20 lessons, you’ll be able to start your application process to either program and begin speaking with an Admissions Advisor regarding your career goals.

## What you will learn

Your path forward looks something like this:

You’ll encounter two different kinds of lessons ahead: __Readmes__, which are mostly text with helpful additions like images or videos and which we use to give you some necessary concepts; and __Labs__, which will give you the opportunity to put the concepts you’re learning into practice. We’ll help you with any setup you need to do along the way, so all you have to do is get started.
